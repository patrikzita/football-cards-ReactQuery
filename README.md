# football-cards-ReactQuery
This project was started as a learning experience using the React Query library. I am aware of the code's mistakes and in the future, 
I plan to write a similar project better and using TypeScript. The main focus was to try out simple communication with an API. 
I did not pay much attention to the project's design aspect, as I mentioned earlier, it is more of a practice project. 
This is also the first time I am extensively using React Bootstrap.

**npx json-server -p 3000 -w API/db.json**
**npm run dev**
